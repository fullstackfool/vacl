<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Vacl is a small, fast and strictly typed ACL for Vue3. It offers simple on-load
configuration for permissions and roles, with helpful template directives 
like `v-can`, `v-cannot`, etc. 

It is not a full ACL system, like [CASL](https://github.com/stalniy/casl/), 
rather an easy-to-start js accompaniment to the likes of the 
[Spatie Laravel Permissions](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package.

Vacl is designed to get you set up with frontend authorisation as fast as possible, 
so you can move on to other things in your SPA.

```html
<!---If the delete permission is matched-->
<button v-can="'delete'">Delete</button>

<!---If the staff role is matched-->
<button v-has="'staff'">Delete</button>
```


### Built With

* [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
* [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
* [Vue Test Utils](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils)
* [Best README Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This library is for Vue3 only. If you need ACL for Vue2 please
consider one of the following:

- [vue-browser-acl](https://github.com/mblarsen/vue-browser-acl)
- [vue-gates](https://github.com/williamcruzme/vue-gates)
- [vue-acl](https://github.com/vilarinholeo/vue-acl) (No `v-can` directive)
- [casl](https://github.com/stalniy/casl/tree/master/packages/casl-vue)

### Installation

1. Install:
   ```sh
   npm install vacl
   ```
   or    
   ```sh
   yarn add vacl
   ```
   
2. Configure:
   ```js
   import VACL from 'vacl';
    
   createApp(App)
   .use(VACL, {
     permissions: ['view products', 'edit products'],
     roles: ['staff', 'editor']
   })
   .mount('#app');
   ``` 

   We are manually passing a `config` object as an example. In reality the roles and permissions
   would be generated on the server and passed to the frontend.
   
   Just ensure the `config` passed to VACL takes the following shape:

   ```ts
   {
     permissions: string[];
     roles: roles[];
   }
   ```
   
   Please note: This is a collective of the roles/permissions that the user _has_, if a match is
   unsuccessful it is assumed the user does not have that role/permission.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Directives
To show or remove an element based on permissions:

```html
<!---If the delete permission is matched-->
<button v-can="'delete'">Delete</button>

<!---If either the delete or archive permission is matched-->
<button v-can:any="'delete,archive'">Delete</button>

<!---If both delete and archive permission is matched-->
<button v-can:all="'delete,archive'">Delete</button>
```

Roles work exactly same, using the `has` directive:

```html
<!---If the staff role is matched-->
<button v-has="'staff'">Delete</button>

<!---If either the staff or editor role is matched-->
<button v-has:any="'staff,editor'">Delete</button>

<!---If both staff and editor role is matched-->
<button v-has:all="'staff,editor'">Delete</button>
```

There are also inverse directives, should you need them:

```html
<!---If the delete permission is missing-->
<button v-cannot="'delete'">Contact an Admin</button>

<!---If either the delete or archive permission is missing-->
<button v-cannot:any="'delete,archive'">Contact an Admin</button>

<!---If both delete and archive permission are missing-->
<button v-cannot:all="'delete,archive'">Contact an Admin</button>
```

For roles:

```html
<!---If the staff role is missing-->
<button v-hasnt="'staff'">Contact an Admin</button>

<!---If either the staff or editor role is missing-->
<button v-hasnt:any="'staff,editor'">Contact an Admin</button>

<!---If both staff and editor role are missing-->
<button v-hasnt:all="'staff,editor'">Contact an Admin</button>
```
